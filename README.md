# C Assembly Project
Convert assembly language code into machine code with this assembler, bridging the gap between human-readable instructions and binary execution.

## Overview

This project focuses on creating an assembler program for a custom assembly language. It aims to bridge the gap between human-readable symbolic code and machine code that computers can execute. The project explores the fundamental concept that computers fundamentally operate in binary code and use assembly language as an intermediary.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop an assembler that simplifies the process of programming for computers. It translates assembly language source code into machine code, enabling programmers to work with a more user-friendly and human-readable symbolic representation of machine instructions. This symbolic code can then be loaded onto a computer for execution. Please note that this project covers the creation of the assembler only and does not address linking and loading stages.

## Virtual Computer Model

The project defines an imaginary computer model with essential components:

- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- General registers (r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7)
- Memory with 1024 cells (words), each 12 bits in size
- Arithmetic operations for integers (no support for real numbers)
- Support for characters and ASCII representation

## Getting Started

To start using the assembler, please refer to the project documentation for installation and usage instructions.
